<summary>A Welcome Message from a Greenstand Founder</summary>
Is your motivation climate change or poverty? We all have our reasons to be here. Maybe you want to be part of an awesome project or maybe you just got a ticket and owe community service. I can’t answer what brought you here - I can only speak for myself.

I once held a stranger's hand when he died. I’d brought him to a hospital and and feeling he was now safe, I was saying goodbye, wishing him luck and that was it - he died. Thinking back on that moment, it leaves a good feeling knowing I’d done everything I could to help him. It was good to be there with him as his friend in his last struggle.

I find it fulfilling to help people. Making the world a better place brings me joy - it makes me feel good. It is painful and depressing to stand by and do nothing while people suffer and we collectively destroy our planet.

There are hundreds of millions of amazing people on our planet who live on less than I spend on a cup of coffee - they are caught in a perpetual struggle to find food. Basic education is not an option - healthcare is not a priority when you are starving. I've seen it. I've witnessed the plight of a single mother in rural Africa. I've seen the story in Central and South America. I understand how our actions in the "developed world" drive climate change and make the poorest people's lives that much harder. It makes me angry - I cannot and will not stand by and do nothing.

For me, Greenstand is a social project. It’s answering the needs of the most powerful climate activists this planet has. If we support that woman in her struggle, she, together with her neighbors and millions of others like her, will clean our atmosphere; they will build the most effective climate solution possible - forests.

Regardless of why you are here, I am excited to welcome you to a growing and powerful community. We are on this planet together and we are not just standing by. We have a plan; we are making it happen. And we need you.

Thank you for joining.

# Do you fit here? 
You should be able to commit to the following or you do not belong here:
- I commit to being nice to everyone I meet here and creating a warm, kind enviroment.
- I commit to not being disruptive.
- I commit to not leaving a mess? This can be creating an empty folder, a poorly written line of code, a sting of junk pull requests, or a jumble of files that no one but you can understand. To add value here you should be careful to leave the world and things you touch cleaner and in better shape than before you arrived.

# To Start

You must be:
 - Self-driven. You are expected to direct yourself to a task within your skill level and do it.
 - Outgoing. There is a community to support you as you go, don't be afraid to ask questions, dive in, and read documents. If you can't find an answer, someone else can't find it as well. Ask and keep on asking.

# Your FIRST TASK: 
1. Orient yourself - take a look around - you should be able to find a team or channel you would like to join or lead. 
2. Understand the technology Greenstand is creating. Map.treetracker.org, you can also view apps, and other dashboards - find a problem to report and if you can't find where or who to report it to ask.
3. Improve documentation - if you got stuck or lost it is mostly a documentation issue! Improving documentation is critical to our success.
